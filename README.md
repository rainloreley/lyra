# Lyra

Open-Source DMX control software

**This software is in development and probably won't work properly yet**

## Installation

_not ready yet, you have to build it from source_

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rainloreley/lyra lyra
cd lyra
yarn
yarn dev # or yarn build if you want a production build
```

## Currently supported devices

1. The only supported DMX Interface is the FX5 USB DMX Interface. More interfaces may be added in the future (lyra can be used without an interface)

2. There are not many DMX lights available yet. More will be added in the future.
